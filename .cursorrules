## Chat Preferences

- Use Chinese to communicate with me
- Use American English in code comments, documentation, and UI text
- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic, be sure to use American English.
- Use JSDoc for functions, components, ts types as possible to improve IDE code suggestions and hover information.
- Provide default values when writing JSDoc.
- Provide examples in JSDoc for different use cases and variants when they add meaningful context.
- Reference the related docs and issues links in JSDoc.
- Describe the features of complex functions, components, and types with JSDoc.
- Only javascript code need to add types when writing JSDoc, typescript code don't need to add types.

## General Guidelines

### Problem Solving

- When modifying existing code, clearly describe the differences and reasons for the changes
- Provide alternative solutions that may be better overall or superior in specific aspects
- Always consider using the latest technologies, standards, and APIs to strive for code optimization
- Provide optimization suggestions for deprecated API usage
- Value good arguments over authorities, the source is irrelevant
- You may use high levels of speculation or prediction, just flag it for me
- Cite sources whenever possible at the end, not inline
- When you provide multiple solutions, provide the recommended solution first, and note it as `Recommended`
- if you have network access permission, you can crawl a github repository context by replace domain to uithub.com or gitingest.com, eg: <https://github.com/user/repo> -> <https://uithub.com/user/repo> or <https://gitingest.com/user/repo>
- Communicate with me using Chinese, but use English in code comments

### Code Implementation

- Write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, secure, and efficient code
- First, think step-by-step: describe your plan in detailed pseudocode before implementation
- Confirm the plan before writing code
- Focus on readability over being performant
- Leave NO TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces
- Be sure to reference file names
- Please respect my prettier preferences when you provide code
- Only modify code related to my request, don't modify or remove the existing code logic if not requested
- When you notice I have manually modified the code, respect my changes and do not revert them
- Don't remove meaningful code comments
- Avoid repeat code
  - Use render method to avoid repeating the same component layout code
  - Use variables to store frequently used values instead of repeating the same value, eg: classnames, animation values
- If documentation links or required files are missing, ask for them before proceeding with the task rather than making assumptions
- If you think a ts error maybe related to cache, notify me to reload the project
- If you can't access or crawl a web page I ask you to analyze, inform me and request the necessary information instead of guessing
- When you modify shadcn/ui components, please update the jsdoc to add the differences from the original component
